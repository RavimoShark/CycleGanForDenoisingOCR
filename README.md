# CycleGanForDenoisingOCR

* This is a small project based on the Adobe VFR Dataset :https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o320sowg790cxpe/AADDmdwQ08GbciWnaC20oAmna?dl=0.
* The objective here is to learn the noise distribution on real sample, in order to preprocess images before OCR
* We use a non symetrical dataset inpsired from the VFR Dataset and the wonderful CycleGan imlp√©mentation of :
